    "Prediction: My prediction for these models is that the Logistic regression will be more accurate because the data is strictly quantitative and logistic regressions usually operate better under those conditions. Additionally, the data set does not have as many noise variables which I think will benefit the logisitic regression. On the contrary, given the amount of data, I think the scores between the two will be very close though. "

    "Which Model tested better?\n",
    "It was extremely close but it appears the Logistic Regression Model tested better at .9924 vs the Random Forest Classifier score of .9922. Furthermore, the data was scaled in order to gain more understanding towards the RFC and, as expected, the training and testing scores were lower. I will give myself some credit because my prediction was correct by choosing the logistic regression model to have a better score and that it was very close. I also find it interesting how high the scores are. My hypothesis for why is because the credit risk variables are very specific and the data size is very large so the model has plenty of line items to develop accuracy. "
